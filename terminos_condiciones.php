                                                <p>We collect non-personally identifiable information regarding offline collected attributes and digital usage patterns of users of mobile devices and computers. In this policy, we refer to this non-personally identifiable information, together with other non-personally identifiable information that we obtain from third parties in order to influence which types of marketing messages and other content are displayed to you, as "Encrypted Audience Preference Data." We use Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data to prepare groups of users, referred to as "segments," based upon their behavior and preferences. We give our customers a limited right to use a user's membership in a segment as a basis for displaying advertisements and other content that are intended to reflect the user's preferences. We also collect non-personally identifiable information for other purposes: for example, to provide aggregate statistics for market research and analytics programs.</p>

                                                <p>We use non-personally identifiable means, including "cookies", "pixel tags," and in some instances, statistical ID's, to collect and store Encrypted Audience Preference Data. We do not use flash cookies.</p>
                                                <p>Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a browser. They are sent to a computer by Web site operators or third parties. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You may, however, be able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse third-party cookies or to indicate when a third-party cookie is being sent. Check your browser's "Help" files to learn more about handling cookies on your browser. Converge 360 Platformcookies will expire after five years from the date they are created. </p>
                                                <p>Pixel tags are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page , document or other means of digital content. Pixel tags allow the operator of the Web page or other means of digital content, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies on, and to transfer other data to, the browser used to view the Web page or other means of digital content. Pixel tags may also be used to obtain information about the computer being used to view that Web page or other document. The entity that sends the tag in some cases can view the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the time it was sent, the user's operating system and browser type, and similar statistic information.</p>
                                                <p>We use information collected at various times and by pixel tags and cookies placed on several Web sites in order to collect Encrypted Audience Preference Data. We may also obtain Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data from third-party sources, and may combine it with other Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data that we have collected.</p>
                                                <p>The Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data that we collect from users includes, for example, a user's browser type and version (e.g., Internet Explorer 7.0, Firefox 3.0, or Safari 3.1.1), and operating system (e.g., Windows Vista, Macintosh OS X, or Android 4.1 for certain mobile users). We also may collect demographic information such as a user's gender, age, and income range. In addition, we may collect information about a user's browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the Web pages on which we are collecting Encrypted Audience Preference Data, the content areas or pages of the Web sites that a user visits (e.g., "sports section" or "technology section"), and other click-stream data, none of which includes personal information about the user.</p>

                                                <p>We are aware of the sensitivity of certain types of Encrypted Audience Preference Data. We do not create or share any segments on the Audience Data Marketplace that reflect Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data that we consider sensitive. While the types of Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data that may be considered sensitive may vary among users, we presently treat Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data as sensitive if it includes data reflecting a user having a medical condition; certain aspects of a user's personal life or financial situation; or use of, or interest in, gambling, alcoholic beverages, or "adult" products or services.

                                                <p>We disclose Encrypted Audience Preference Data, and information derived from Encrypted Audience Preference Data, to our customers (including Ad Networks and Demand Side Plaforms) in the ordinary course of our business. We indicate to our customers a user's membership within a segment at various times. For example, we may tag an anonymous user as a member of a segment when the user views certain Web pages that are operated or controlled by a customer. Our customers may use a user's membership within a segment to display advertisements and other content that are targeted to the user. Our customers may also use third-party service providers, acting on behalf of those customers, to display advertising or other content that reflects a user's membership in a segment. We do not authorize our customers to resell Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data to third parties. Please note that our customers  and Data Partners have their own data retention policies, Data Privacy Policies and Terms of Use and Conditions. </p>
                                                <p>Because Converge 360 Platform provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, service, data partner or other third party. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this document, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, service , data partner or other third party govern with respect to your use of such app, product ,service, data partner or other third party to the extent of the conflict.</p>
                                                <p>We may share Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data with third-party service providers (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) in order for those service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf.</p>
                                                <p>We may also disclose Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data if we believe that we have a legal obligation to do so.</p>
                                                <p>In addition, information in our possession or control, including Encrypted Audience Preference Data, may be disclosed in connection with any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or other business transaction in which data could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.</p>
                                                <h4 class="font-bold mrg10B mrg10T">Mobile Device Encrypted Audience Preference Data</h4>
                                                <p>Converge 360 Platformenables clients to utilize Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data via mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. In many respects, the process we use in mobile is similar to those we've used for our online Encrypted Audience Preference Data. However, as cookies are less reliable on mobile devices, Converge 360 Platformuses statistical ID's to help us process mobile Encrypted Audience Preference Data. The use of statistical ID's does not impact Converge 360 Platformcurrent data retention rate.</p>
                                                <p>Converge 360 Platformhas also developed the Mobile Privacy Samurai - a privacy enhancing technology for the mobile advertising marketplace. Mobile Privacy Samurai utilizes similar noise injection techniques to those which are commonly used in various fields to protect anonymity. The Converge 360 PlatformMobile Privacy Samurai inserts additional noise into the mobile Encrypted Audience Encrypted Audience Preference Data we collect, which makes it significantly more difficult for anyone—including Converge 360 Platform—to re-identify any particular mobile User. For example, when a device is "tagged" with actual behaviors performed by a device, a set of recommended attributes are injected into the mobile device profile. This ensures the mobile device is immediately anonymized to protect the consumer, but still valuable and relevant for advertisers.

                                                <p>We believe that structure and organized data is key to the future and will help human kind to resolve issues that could be prevent just by looking at patterns on big data and applied data sciences. We want to be a part of that future.</p> 
                                                <p>For example: Precision Health - “Through our initiatives in precision health, we will be able to harness the availability of very large data sets and our ability to interpret and analyze that data to gain a more sophisticated understanding of the determinants of health and well-being, as well as specific risk factors and approaches for individual patients,” -  Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Stanford Medicine School.</p>
                                                <p>Stanford School of Medicine researchers detected a pattern of gene activity that could lead to the development of a blood test to quickly and accurately detect sepsis, a deadly, whole-body inflammation syndrome. Sepsis is linked to 750,000 deaths each year in the United States and is the most common cause of hospital deaths.</p>
